          <p>
            These Terms & Conditions (“Terms”) govern all dealings between Nubexs USA LLC
            (“we”, “us”, “our”) and the client (“you”, “customer”). By requesting a quotation,

            We provide custom software development, mobile apps, web applications, UI/UX design,
            consulting, and technical support based solely on the information provided by the client.
            Delivery quality depends on the accuracy of client-provided requirements.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">6. Delivery & Timelines</h2>
          <p>
            Timelines depend on scope, technical complexity, client responsiveness, and
            third-party dependencies. We are not responsible for delays caused by external factors.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">7. Third-Party Services Disclaimer</h2>

            hosting providers, app stores, plugins, libraries, or outsourced developers.
            All third-party liability is ZERO.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">8. Zero Manipulation / Zero Blackmail Policy</h2>

          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">9. Communication Verification</h2>
          <p>
            All instructions given through Email, WhatsApp, written messages, or project tools
            are considered final and binding. Clients cannot later deny instructions they approved.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">10. Confidentiality</h2>

            maximum liability is limited to the amount paid for that deliverable. We are not liable
            for business loss, data loss, operational downtime, or indirect damages.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-white">13. Project Termination</h2>
          <p>
            We may terminate the project if payments are delayed, the client becomes uncooperative,
            or attempts manipulation. No refunds will be issued in such cases.
